## KQL Queries to Explore the Data
Key Query Language (KQL) is a powerful tool for querying and analyzing your data stored in Azure Data Explorer. It enables you to perform various data exploration tasks, from basic aggregations to advanced analytics. Below, we highlight some essential KPIs that you can derive using KQL queries.

Calculated Some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Total Sales:** Calculate the overall sales amount across all products and outlets.
- **Average Weight Of Product:** Determine the average weight of products in your dataset.
- **Average Product Visibility:** Compute the average visibility of products on store shelves.
- **Product Type Analysis:** Analyze the performance of different product categories.
- **Outlet Performance:** Evaluate the overall performance of sales outlets, considering factors like revenue and customer satisfaction.
- **Location Analysis:** Gain insights into sales performance across different geographical locations.
- **Outlet Type Analysis:** Explore performance variations among different outlet types.
- **Regional Analysis:** Understand sales trends and patterns in various regions.
- **Outlet Performance By Establishment Year:** Analyze outlet performance based on the year of establishment.
- **Outlet Type Market Share:** Calculate the market share of different outlet types.
- **Outlet Size Analysis:** Explore sales performance in relation to outlet sizes.

## Dashboard

In the context of a dashboard, the following KPIs can be explain in simple terms.

The "Top Selling Product" KPI shows the product that generates the highest sales, indicating its popularity and demand. On the other hand, the "Least Selling Product" KPI highlights the product with the lowest sales, indicating potential issues or areas for improvement. "Product Type Analysis" focuses on analyzing the performance and sales of different product categories, helping identify trends and opportunities.

"Outlet Performance" assesses the overall performance of sales outlets, evaluating factors such as revenue, customer satisfaction, and efficiency. "Outlet Performance by Establishment Year" provides insights into how outlet performance varies based on when each outlet was established, potentially revealing patterns or discrepancies.
"Average Sales per Product" measures the average amount of sales generated by each individual product, aiding in identifying high-performing or underperforming items.

Lastly, "Location Analysis" examines the sales performance and trends across different geographical State locations sub Tier cities like 1, 2, 3, enabling businesses to make informed decisions about expansion, marketing, and targeting specific areas.
